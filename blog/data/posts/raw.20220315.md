Well, after almost exactly half a year, I'm back to working on this side project!

Today's goal is to set up the project page to be able to link to all the posts for that project, in chronological order. Won't worry about separating it into pages or anything like that, but that way, I can at least go and see what the different posts are without checking Firebase for the right hash to manually put into the URL.
